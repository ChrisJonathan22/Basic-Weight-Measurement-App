# Basic-Weight-Measurement-App

This is a weight measurement app which takes the user's weight measurement, sends it to the database and then displays it with the date/time of when it was created.

Once forked, whilst within the root folder and in the Terminal type in "npm install" to install all the dependencies.

To run the app go to the backEnd folder type in "node server" and then create another instance of the Terminal where you would need to install the Angular Cli if you haven't got it.
Run the Angular app whilst inside the Angular App/ basicApp root folder and type in "ng serve --o" to start the server and open the page on the browser.
